### Architecture

[Back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

<img src="assets/svg/dg/ArchitectureDiagram.svg" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T10-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T10-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.

* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `deletePerson 1`.

<img src="assets/svg/dg/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.svg" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="assets/svg/dg/ComponentManagers.svg" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### UI component

[Back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T10-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](assets/svg/dg/UiClassDiagram.svg)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T10-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T10-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` and `Task` object residing in the `Model`.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Logic component

[Back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T10-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="assets/svg/dg/LogicClassDiagram.svg" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("deleteTask 1")` API call as an example.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `deleteTask 1` Command](assets/svg/dg/DeleteTaskSequenceDiagram.svg)

{% include admonition.html type="note" title="Note" body="

The lifeline for <code>DeleteTaskCommandParser</code> should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

" %}

The sequence diagrams below show the details of the respective reference frames.

![DeleteTaskInTaskList](assets/svg/dg/SDDeleteTaskInTaskList.svg)

![CreateDeleteTaskCommandResult](assets/svg/dg/SDCreateDeleteTaskCommandResult.svg)

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteTaskCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
2. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteTaskCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
3. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).
4. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="assets/svg/dg/ParserClasses.svg" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddPersonCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddPersonCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddPersonCommandParser`, `DeletePersonCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Model component

[Back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T10-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="assets/svg/dg/ModelClassDiagram.svg" width="450" />

The `Model` component,

* stores the data currently in CoordiMate i.e., all `Person` objects and `Task` objects.
  * These objects are contained in `UniquePersonList` and `UniqueTaskList` objects respectively.
* stores the lists currently 'selected' `Person` and `Task` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as separate _filtered_ lists which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` and `ObservableList<Task>` that can be 'observed'.
  * e.g. the UI can be bound to these lists so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the lists change.

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

{% include admonition.html type="note" title="Note" body="

An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a <code>Tag</code> list in the <code>AddressBook</code>, which <code>Person</code> references. This allows <code>AddressBook</code> to only require one <code>Tag</code> object per unique tag, instead of each <code>Person</code> needing their own <code>Tag</code> objects. <br><br>

<img src='assets/svg/dg/BetterModelClassDiagram.svg' width='450' />

" %}

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Storage component

[Back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T10-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="assets/svg/dg/StorageClassDiagram.svg" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both CoordiMate's data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Common classes

[Back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

## **Implementation**

[Back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Add Tag(s) To Person feature

[Back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

#### Implementation

The `addTagPerson` command is designed to allow users to add tags to existing persons in CoordiMate. It takes in an index to specify which person to add the tags to. It then takes in one or more tags to add to the list of existing tags of the specified person.

To get a visual representation of how the `addTagPerson` command operates, the sequence diagram below provides a detailed overview:

![AddTagPersonSequenceDiagram](assets/svg/dg/AddTagPersonSequenceDiagram.svg)

{% include admonition.html type="note" title="Note" body="

The lifeline for <code>AddTagPersonCommandParser</code> and <code>AddTagPersonCommand</code> should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

" %}

The sequence diagrams below show the details of the respective reference frames.

![AddTagsToPerson](assets/svg/dg/SDAddTagsToPerson.svg)

![CreateAddTagCommandResult](assets/svg/dg/SDCreateAddTagCommandResult.svg)

#### Design considerations

**Aspect: Design and format of task display:**

* **Alternative 1:** Simply present tasks using basic string output.
  * Pros: Direct approach and simple to design and implement.
  * Cons: Users are unsure which of their tag inputs are duplicates of current tag in existing list of tags for the specified person and which have been newly added due to their input. <br/><br/>

* **Alternative 2 (current choice):** Present tasks using basic string output and indicates which of the input tags are duplicates of existing tags for the specified person and which have been newly added to the list of tags.
  * Pros: Users are able to identify which of their tag inputs are duplicates of current tag in existing list of tags for the specified person and which have been newly added due to their input.
  * Cons: More complex to design and implement.
  * Cons: Result output is longer and harder to read for users. <br/><br/>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### List Task feature

[Back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

#### Implementation

The `listTask` command is designed to exhibit all tasks currently stored within CoordiMate to the user. It takes in no arguments and provides a straightforward view of all tasks in their current state.

To get a visual representation of how the `listTask` command operates, the sequence diagram below provides a detailed overview:

![ListTaskSequenceDiagram](assets/svg/dg/ListTaskSequenceDiagram.svg)

{% include admonition.html type="note" title="Note" body="

The lifeline for <code>ListTaskCommand</code> should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

" %}

#### Design considerations

**Aspect: Design and format of task display:**

* **Alternative 1:** Simply present tasks using basic string output.
  * Pros: Direct approach and simple to design and implement.
  * Cons: Can seem too plain and might not capture users' attention effectively. <br/><br/>

* **Alternative 2 (current choice):** Offer a more structured and visually enhanced display format for tasks.
  * Pros: Ensures better user engagement due to organized and eye-catching content presentation.
  * Cons: Can be challenging to implement given the added layers of design and subsequent testing.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Edit Task feature

[Back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

#### Implementation

The `editTask` command accepts an index, title, note, and tags, and edits the task at that index with the new fields. The index should be numeric. The title, note, and tags can be any string. At least one of the title, note, or tag must be provided for the command to be valid.

The sequence diagram below illustrates how the `editTask` command works for the example input `editTask 1 T/title n/note t/tag`.

![EditTaskSequenceDiagram](assets/svg/dg/EditTaskSequenceDiagram.svg)

{% include admonition.html type="note" title="Note" body="

The lifeline for <code>EditTaskCommandParser</code> and <code>EditTaskCommand</code> should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

" %}

The sequence diagrams below show the details of the respective reference frames.

![CreateEditTaskDescriptor](assets/svg/dg/SDCreateEditTaskDescriptor.svg)

![EditTaskInTaskList](assets/svg/dg/SDEditTaskInTaskList.svg)

![CreateEditTaskCommandResult](assets/svg/dg/SDCreateEditTaskCommandResult.svg)


#### Design considerations

**Aspect: How to encapsulate edited fields:**

* **Alternative 1:** Store each edited field in a separate variable directly into `EditTaskCommand` after parsing.
  * Pros: Simple to implement.
  * Cons: Low level of abstraction. Difficult to test, maintain, and extend if more fields are to be added. It is also difficult to pass each field around to classes that need access to the edited fields.  <br/><br/>

* **Alternative 2 (current choice):** Encapsulate edited fields in a `EditTaskDescriptor` class.
  * Pros: High level of abstraction. Encapsulation allows the details of an `editTask` command to be passed around as a single object to be used by other classes.
  * Cons: More complex to implement due to boilerplate code.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Find Task feature

[Back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

#### Implementation

The `findTask` command accepts a String of space-separated keywords, and returns a list of tasks that contain any of their keywords in their title or note. The search is case-insensitive.

The sequence diagram below illustrates how the `findTask` command works.

![FindTaskSequenceDiagram](assets/svg/dg/FindTaskSequenceDiagram.svg)

{% include admonition.html type="note" title="Note" body="

The lifeline for <code>FindTaskCommandParser</code> and <code>FindTaskCommand</code> should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

" %}

The sequence diagrams below show the details of the respective reference frames.

![CreateTaskPredicate](assets/svg/dg/SDCreateTaskPredicate.svg)

![CreateFindTaskCommandResult](assets/svg/dg/SDCreateFindTaskCommandResult.svg)

This feature is accomplished by a `TaskContainsKeywordPredicate` class which is used to filter the list of tasks in the `Model` component.

The `TaskContainsKeywordPredicate` class creates two more `Predicate<Task>` objects using the provided search terms, namely, `TitleContainsKeywordPredicate` and `NoteContainsKeywordPredicate`, which are omitted from the diagram above for brevity.

The `TitleContainsKeywordPredicate` object checks if a given task's `Title` contains any of the keywords in the search term.

The `NoteContainsKeywordPredicate` object checks if a given task's `Note` contains any of the keywords in the search term.

These two predicates are used to filter the list of tasks in the `Model` component, by using a short-circuiting OR operation to combine the two predicates.

#### Design considerations

**Aspect: How to implement the `Predicate<Task>` class:**

* **Alternative 1:** Use a single `TaskContainsKeywordPredicate` class that implements `Predicate<Task>` to search both the task's `Title` and `Note`.
  * Pros: Simple to implement.
  * Cons: Not extensible. If we want to search other fields in the future, we will have to modify the `TaskContainsKeywordPredicate` class. <br/><br/>


* **Alternative 2 (current choice):** Use two `Predicate<Task>` classes, namely, `TitleContainsKeywordPredicate` and `NoteContainsKeywordPredicate`, to search the task's `Title` and `Note` respectively.
  * Pros: Extensible. We can easily add more `Predicate<Task>` classes to search other fields in the future. <br/>These classes also allow us to search the task's `Title` and `Note` separately, if needed.
  * Cons: More complex to implement.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Mark Task feature

[Back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

#### Implementation

The `markTask` command accepts an index and marks the task at that index with task status of **done**. The index should be numeric.

The sequence diagram below illustrates how the `markTask` command works for the example input `markTask 1`.

![MarkTaskSequenceDiagram](assets/svg/dg/MarkTaskSequenceDiagram.svg)

{% include admonition.html type="note" title="Note" body="

The lifeline for <code>MarkTaskCommandParser</code>, <code>ParserUtil</code> and <code>MarkTaskCommand</code> should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

" %}

The activity diagram below models the action sequence of how the `markTask` command works for the example input `markTask 1`.

![MarkTaskActivityDiagram](assets/svg/dg/MarkTaskActivityDiagram.svg)

{% include admonition.html type="note" title="Note" body="

Since the beta syntax does not support placing the condition outside the diamond we place it as the true branch instead.

" %}


#### Design considerations

**Aspect: How to create status of a Task:**

* **Alternative 1:** Using String input to create a status.
  * Pros: Simple to implement. Provides flexibility, allowing for dynamic input without changing code.
  * Cons: Can lead to potential issues related to typos or inconsistent naming conventions.
Any string can be passed as a status, potentially resulting in invalid or unexpected states.<br/><br/>

* **Alternative 2 (current choice):** Using an enum input to create a status.
  * Pros: Provides a type-safe way to represent task statuses, ensuring that only valid status values can be used. If new status types are introduced, developers can easily update the TaskStatus enum, ensuring all usages are consistent
  * Cons: More complex to implement. Require modifying the enum itself to add new status types, potentially leading to more extensive code changes <br/><br/>

**Aspect: How to update the task status of a Task:**

* **Alternative 1:** Directly change the status attribute of each task every time it is marked.
  * Pros: More memory-efficient
  * Cons: Not immutable. Can lead to challenges in testing and tracking task state changes over time <br/><br/>

* **Alternative 2 (current choice):** Create a new task with same details and a done status every time it is marked.
  * Pros: Ensures immutability and preserves the history of task states, allowing for easy tracking of changes and maintaining a clear historical record of task statuses.
  * Cons: Incur a slight performance overhead, especially if the tasks contain a large amount of data, impacting the overall execution speed of the program. <br/><br/>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Delete Task feature

[Back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

#### Implementation

The `deleteTask` command accepts a numeric Index, and removes the task at that index from the task list.

The sequence diagram below illustrates how the `deleteTask` command works for the example input `deleteTask 1`.

![DeleteTaskSequenceDiagram](assets/svg/dg/DeleteTaskSequenceDiagram.svg)

{% include admonition.html type="note" title="Note" body="

The lifeline for <code>DeleteTaskCommandParser</code> and <code>DeleteTaskCommand</code> should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

" %}

The sequence diagrams below show the details of the respective reference frames.

![DeleteTaskInTaskList](assets/svg/dg/SDDeleteTaskInTaskList.svg)

![CreateDeleteTaskCommandResult](assets/svg/dg/SDCreateDeleteTaskCommandResult.svg)

#### Design considerations

**Aspect: How delete executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Deletes task based on the filtered list shown to the user.
  * Pros: Users do not have to use the `listTask` command everytime before they delete a task.
  * Cons: Users cannot delete a task that is not shown in the filtered list. <br/><br/>

* **Alternative 2:** Deletes task based on the full list of tasks.
  * Pros: Users can delete a task that is not shown in the filtered list.
  * Cons: Users have to use the `listTask` command everytime to confirm the index of the task before they delete the task.

## **Appendix: Planned Enhancements**

[Back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

### 1. Character limits for person fields and tasks

- **Enhancement**: Implement character limits for various fields associated with persons and tasks to ensure data consistency and integrity.
- **Reason**: To maintain a structured format for data entry and prevent excessively long inputs that could affect the display and usability of the system.
- **Examples**:
  - For `Person` entities:
    - **Name**: Limit to 1 - 100 characters to ensure the name is detailed enough yet concise.
    - **Phone**: Limit to 3 - 15 characters to accommodate international formats without extraneous digits.
    - **Email**: Limit to 5 - 100 characters to include most valid email addresses while preventing abuse.
    - **Address**: Maximum of 200 characters to include full addresses in a readable format.
  - For `Task` entities:
    - **Title**: Limit to 1 - 100 characters to encapsulate the task effectively.
    - **Note**: Limit to 1 - 200 characters to provide a thorough description without becoming verbose.
  - For `Person/Task` tags:
    - **Tag**: Maximum of 30 characters to keep tags succinct and meaningful.

### 2. Command-specific error messages

- **Enhancement**: Error messages will pinpoint the specific part of the command that has triggered the error.
- **Reason**: Users will be able to identify and correct the exact issue with their command input without having to guess which part was incorrect.
- **Examples**:
    - For an invalid command due to an excessively long or short user input, a possible error message would be "Invalid addPerson command: person's name exceeded 100 characters."
    - For tag-related commands, specifying error messages such as changing "Tag names should be alphanumeric" to "Tag names should be ONLY alphanumeric" for better clarity.

### 3. Stricter validity checks for email addresses

- **Enhancement**: Revise the regex used for validating email addresses to ensure the domain name is present and correctly formatted.
- **Reason**: To prevent the acceptance of invalid email addresses that lack a top-level domain e.g. `.com`, which are not very usable for actual communication.
- **Example**:
  - The current regex might validate `johndoe@example`, which is incorrect as it lacks a domain name. The enhanced regex would correctly invalidate this and require a proper top-level domain, like `johndoe@example.com`.

### 4. Accommodating Special Characters in Person Names

- **Enhancement**: Update the name input validation to allow some special characters that are part of valid names in various cultures, including diacritics and other linguistic markers.
- **Reason**: To ensure the software is inclusive and capable of accurately recording names from a diverse range of ethnic backgrounds.
- **Example**:
  - Under the current system, a name like "Séamus O'Connor" or "Anand Sai-Krishna" might be rejected due to special characters. The enhancement would allow these names to be entered and stored correctly.

### 5. Enhanced UI indicators for empty person/tasks lists

- **Enhancement**: Implement clear and prominent UI indicators when task or person lists are empty, particularly after performing actions such as marking tasks complete.
- **Reason**: To provide immediate and unmistakable visual feedback to users when there are no items to display, enhancing the user experience by avoiding potential confusion or the impression that the list may not have loaded properly.
- **Example**:
  - After a user completes the last remaining task with `markTask` and no incomplete tasks are left, instead of the minimalistic message "0 tasks listed!", the UI could display a more noticeable and friendly graphic or message such as "All tasks complete!" within the task list itself. This visual cue would be both informative and encouraging to the user.

### 6. Preventing list jump on selection

- **Enhancement**: Modify the UI behavior to maintain the current scroll position when selecting an item at the bottom of a list.
- **Reason**: To improve the usability of the application, especially when dealing with long lists, by preventing the list from jumping back to the top after selection.
- **Example**:
  - Currently, when a user selects an item at the bottom of a long list, the list resets to the top position. This enhancement will keep the list at the current scroll position, making it easier to manage and navigate long lists.
