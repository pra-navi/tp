### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T10-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T10-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.

* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `deletePerson 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T10-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T10-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T10-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` and `Task` object residing in the `Model`.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T10-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `deletePerson 1` Command](images/DeletePersonSequenceDiagram.png)

{% include admonition.html type="note" title="Note" body="

The lifeline for <code>DeletePersonCommandParser</code> should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of 
PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

" %}

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
2. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeletePersonCommand`) 
   which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
3. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).
4. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a 
  placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddPersonCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to 
  parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddPersonCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` 
  returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddPersonCommandParser`, `DeletePersonCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the 
  `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T10-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

{% include admonition.html type="note" title="Note" body="

An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a <code>Tag</code> list in the <code>AddressBook</code>, which <code>Person</code> references. This allows <code>AddressBook</code> to only require one <code>Tag</code> object per unique tag, instead of each <code>Person</code> needing their own <code>Tag</code> objects. <br>

<img src='images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png' width='450' />

" %}

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T10-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Delete Person feature

#### Implementation

The `deletePerson` command accepts a numeric Index, and removes the person at that index from the person list.

The sequence diagram below illustrates how the `deletePerson` command works for the example input `deletePerson 1`.

![DeletePersonSequenceDiagram](images/DeletePersonSequenceDiagram.png)

{% include admonition.html type="note" title="Note" body="

The lifeline for <code>DeletePersonCommandParser</code> and <code>DeletePersonCommand</code> should end at the destroy 
marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

" %}

#### Design considerations

**Aspect: How delete executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Deletes task based on the filtered list shown to the user.
    * Pros: Users do not have to use the `listPerson` command everytime before they delete a person.
    * Cons: Users cannot delete a person that is not shown in the filtered list. <br/><br/>

* **Alternative 2:** Deletes person based on the full list of persons.
    * Pros: Users can delete a person that is not shown in the filtered list.
    * Cons: Users have to use the `listPerson` command everytime to confirm the index of the person before they 
      delete the person.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### List Task feature

#### Implementation

The `listTask` command is designed to exhibit all tasks currently stored within CoordiMate to the user. It takes in no arguments and provides a straightforward view of all tasks in their current state.

To get a visual representation of how the `listTask` command operates, the sequence diagram below provides a detailed overview:

![ListTaskSequenceDiagram](assets/svg/dg/ListTaskSequenceDiagram.svg)

{% include admonition.html type="note" title="Note" body="

The lifeline for <code>ListTaskCommand</code> should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

" %}

#### Design considerations

**Aspect: Design and format of task display:**

* **Alternative 1:** Simply present tasks using basic string output.
    * Pros: Direct approach and simple to design and implement.
    * Cons: Can seem too plain and might not capture users' attention effectively. <br/><br/>

* **Alternative 2 (current choice):** Offer a more structured and visually enhanced display format for tasks.
    * Pros: Ensures better user engagement due to organized and eye-catching content presentation.
    * Cons: Can be challenging to implement given the added layers of design and subsequent testing.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Edit Task feature

#### Implementation

The `editTask` command accepts an index, title, note, and tags, and edits the task at that index with the new fields. The index should be numeric. The title, note, and tags can be any string. At least one of the title, note, or tag must be provided for the command to be valid.

The sequence diagram below illustrates how the `editTask` command works for the example input `editTask 1 T/title n/note t/tag`.

![EditTaskSequenceDiagram](assets/svg/dg/EditTaskSequenceDiagram.svg)

{% include admonition.html type="note" title="Note" body="

The lifeline for <code>EditTaskCommandParser</code> and <code>EditTaskCommand</code> should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

" %}

#### Design considerations

**Aspect: How to encapsulate edited fields:**

* **Alternative 1:** Store each edited field in a separate variable directly into `EditTaskCommand` after parsing.
      * Pros: Simple to implement.
      * Cons: Low level of abstraction. Difficult to test, maintain, and extend if more fields are to be added. It is also difficult to pass each field around to classes that need access to the edited fields.  <br/><br/>

* **Alternative 2 (current choice):** Encapsulate edited fields in a `EditTaskDescriptor` class.
      * Pros: High level of abstraction. Encapsulation allows the details of an `editTask` command to be passed around as a single object to be used by other classes.
      * Cons: More complex to implement due to boilerplate code.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Find Task feature

#### Implementation

The `findTask` command accepts a String of space-separated keywords, and returns a list of tasks that contain any of their keywords in their title or note. The search is case-insensitive.

The sequence diagram below illustrates how the `findTask` command works.

![FindTaskSequenceDiagram](assets/svg/dg/FindTaskSequenceDiagram.svg)

{% include admonition.html type="note" title="Note" body="

The lifeline for <code>FindTaskCommandParser</code>, <code>TaskContainsKeywordsPredicate</code> and <code>FindTaskCommand</code> should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

" %}

This feature is accomplished by a `TaskContainsKeywordPredicate` class which is used to filter the list of tasks in the `Model` component.

The `TaskContainsKeywordPredicate` class creates two more `Predicate<Task>` objects using the provided search terms, namely, `TitleContainsKeywordPredicate` and `NoteContainsKeywordPredicate`, which are omitted from the diagram above for brevity.

The `TitleContainsKeywordPredicate` object checks if a given task's `Title` contains any of the keywords in the search term.

The `NoteContainsKeywordPredicate` object checks if a given task's `Note` contains any of the keywords in the search term.

These two predicates are used to filter the list of tasks in the `Model` component, by using a short-circuiting OR operation to combine the two predicates.

#### Design considerations

**Aspect: How to implement the `Predicate<Task>` class:**

  * **Alternative 1:** Use a single `TaskContainsKeywordPredicate` class that implements `Predicate<Task>` to search both the task's `Title` and `Note`.
    * Pros: Simple to implement.
    * Cons: Not extensible. If we want to search other fields in the future, we will have to modify the `TaskContainsKeywordPredicate` class. <br/><br/>


  * **Alternative 2 (current choice):** Use two `Predicate<Task>` classes, namely, `TitleContainsKeywordPredicate` and `NoteContainsKeywordPredicate`, to search the task's `Title` and `Note` respectively.
    * Pros: Extensible. We can easily add more `Predicate<Task>` classes to search other fields in the future. <br/>These classes also allow us to search the task's `Title` and `Note` separately, if needed.
    * Cons: More complex to implement.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Mark Task feature

#### Implementation

The `markTask` command accepts an index and marks the task at that index with task status of **done**. The index should be numeric.

The sequence diagram below illustrates how the `markTask` command works for the example input `markTask 1`.

![MarkTaskSequenceDiagram](assets/svg/dg/MarkTaskSequenceDiagram.svg)

{% include admonition.html type="note" title="Note" body="

The lifeline for <code>MarkTaskCommandParser</code>, <code>ParserUtil</code> and <code>MarkTaskCommand</code> should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

" %}

#### Design considerations

**Aspect: How to create status of a Task:**

* **Alternative 1:** Using String input to create a status.
    * Pros: Simple to implement. Provides flexibility, allowing for dynamic input without changing code.
    * Cons: Can lead to potential issues related to typos or inconsistent naming conventions.
  Any string can be passed as a status, potentially resulting in invalid or unexpected states.<br/><br/>

* **Alternative 2 (current choice):** Using an enum input to create a status.
    * Pros: Provides a type-safe way to represent task statuses, ensuring that only valid status values can be used. If new status types are introduced, developers can easily update the TaskStatus enum, ensuring all usages are consistent
    * Cons: More complex to implement. Require modifying the enum itself to add new status types, potentially leading to more extensive code changes <br/><br/>

**Aspect: How to update the task status of a Task:**

* **Alternative 1:** Directly change the status attribute of each task every time it is marked.
    * Pros: More memory-efficient
    * Cons: Not immutable. Can lead to challenges in testing and tracking task state changes over time <br/><br/>

* **Alternative 2 (current choice):** Create a new task with same details and a done status every time it is marked.
    * Pros: Ensures immutability and preserves the history of task states, allowing for easy tracking of changes and maintaining a clear historical record of task statuses.
    * Cons: Incur a slight performance overhead, especially if the tasks contain a large amount of data, impacting the overall execution speed of the program. <br/><br/>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Delete Task feature

#### Implementation

The `deleteTask` command accepts a numeric Index, and removes the task at that index from the task list.

The sequence diagram below illustrates how the `deleteTask` command works for the example input `deleteTask 1`.

![DeleteTaskSequenceDiagram](images/DeleteTaskSequenceDiagram.png)

{% include admonition.html type="note" title="Note" body="

The lifeline for <code>DeleteTaskCommandParser</code> and <code>DeleteTaskCommand</code>  should end at the destroy 
marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

" %}

#### Design considerations

**Aspect: How delete executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Deletes task based on the filtered list shown to the user.
    * Pros: Users do not have to use the `listTask` command everytime before they delete a task.
    * Cons: Users cannot delete a task that is not shown in the filtered list. <br/><br/>

* **Alternative 2:** Deletes task based on the full list of tasks.
    * Pros: Users can delete a task that is not shown in the filtered list.
    * Cons: Users have to use the `listTask` command everytime to confirm the index of the task before they delete the
      task.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David â€¦â€‹` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

{% include admonition.html type="note" title="Note" body="

If a command fails its execution, it will not call <code>Model#commitAddressBook()</code>, so the address book state will not be saved into the <code>addressBookStateList</code>.

" %}

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

{% include admonition.html type="note" title="Note" body="

If the <code>currentStatePointer</code> is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The <code>undo</code> command uses <code>Model#canUndoAddressBook()</code> to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

" %}

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

{% include admonition.html type="note" title="Note" body="

The lifeline for <code>UndoCommand</code> should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

" %}

The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

{% include admonition.html type="note" title="Note" body="

If the <code>currentStatePointer</code> is at index <code>addressBookStateList.size() - 1</code>, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The <code>redo</code> command uses <code>Model#canRedoAddressBook()</code> to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

" %}

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David â€¦â€‹` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.
