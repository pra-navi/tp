<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Words in <code>UPPER_CASE</code> are the fields to be supplied by the user.<br>
      e.g. in <code>addPerson n/NAME</code>, <code>NAME</code> is a field which can be used as <code>addPerson n/John Doe</code>, where <code>John Doe</code> is the value of the field <code>NAME</code>. <br>
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      Fields in square brackets are optional.<br>
      e.g <code>n/NAME [t/TAG]</code> can be used as <code>n/John Doe t/friend</code> or as <code>n/John Doe</code>.<br>
      Note that the square brackets (<code>[</code> and <code>]</code>) are not part of the syntax.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      Fields in square brackets with <code>…</code> after them can be used multiple times, including zero times.<br>

### Command Aliases

[Back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

CoordiMate supports predefined aliases for commands, so that you can get things done faster!<br>

**Example 1: Adding a person**

Instead of typing:

<div class="highlight">
  <pre class="highlight"><code><b>addPerson</b> n/John Doe p/12345678 e/john@example.com a/1 John Street t/friend</code></pre>
</div>

you can simply type:

<div class="highlight">
  <pre class="highlight"><code><b>ap</b> n/John Doe p/12345678 e/john@example.com a/1 John Street t/friend</code></pre>
</div>

Both commands will add a person named `John Doe` with phone number `12345678`, email `john@example.com`, address `1 John Street`, and tag `friend` to your contact list.<br><br>

<br>

**Example 2: Listing all persons**

Instead of typing:

<div class="highlight">
  <pre class="highlight"><code><b>listPerson</b></code></pre>
</div>

you can simply type:

<div class="highlight">
  <pre class="highlight"><code><b>lp</b></code></pre>
</div>

Both commands will show a full list of all the contacts in your contact list.

<br>

A summary of valid aliases is shown in the [Command Summary](#command-summary) section below.
