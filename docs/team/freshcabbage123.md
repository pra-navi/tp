### Project: CoordiMate

CoordiMate is a **desktop application** designed specifically for **SoC Computing Club event planners** to help **manage their contacts and tasks** for their events, so that they can focus on the event itself.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: `addPerson` (PR [#73](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T10-2/tp/pull/73))
  * What it does: Allows users to quickly add new contacts uniquely identified by their name.
  * Justification: Essential for users to keep track of new people that they meet.
  * Credits: The `addPerson` command was adapted from the `add` command in the AddressBook-Level3 project (AB3) created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).<br><br>

* **New Feature**: `listPerson` (PR [#82](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T10-2/tp/pull/82))
  * What it does: Provides users with the ability to view a list of all contacts currently stored in the system.
  * Justification: Essential for users to get an overview of their network, the listPerson command centralizes contact information in an accessible manner.
  * Highlights:  Focuses on user convenience by bringing forth a streamlined overview of contacts, promoting better task management.
  * Credits: The `listPerson` command was adapted from the `list` command in the AddressBook-Level3 project (AB3) created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).<br><br>

* **New Feature**: `listTask` (PR [#87](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T10-2/tp/pull/87))
